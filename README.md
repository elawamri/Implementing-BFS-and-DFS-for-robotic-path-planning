# Implementing-BFS-and-DFS-for-robotic-path-planning
## Intoduction
Search-Based Planning is a motion planning approach that uses graph search methods to compute paths or
trajectories in a discretized environment, this project uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
as a Search-Based Planning Algorithms, and it's implemented using python with a predefined bitmap.

## Trials
a various trials have been carried out with different start and goal points.

**- Breadth-First-Search Algorithm 1st Trial,**  This path was generated using point **[0,0]** as an initial
point _(Start)_ and **[0,5]** as an ending point _(Goal)_, as we see the
algorithm was succeeded to achieve its mission and we have a free-obstacles path from start
point to the end one.

**- Breadth-First-Search Algorithm 2nd Trial,** This path was generated using point **[0,0]** as an initial
point _(Start)_ and **[180,620]** as an ending point _(Goal)_ , the map is updated to be a number-like obstacle.

**- Depth-First-Search Algorithm 1st Trial,** This path was generated using depth first algorithm with
**[0,0]** as initial point _(Start)_ to point [0,5] as ending point _(Goal)_

**- Depth-First-Search Algorithm 2nd Trial,** This path was generated using depth first algorithm with
**[0,0]** as initial point _(Start)_ to point **[5,5]** as ending point _(Goal)_ , and as we see the path isnâ€™t optimal at all
however we reached to our goal at the end.
