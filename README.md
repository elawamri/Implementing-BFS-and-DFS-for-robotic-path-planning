# Implementing-BFS-and-DFS-for-robotic-path-planning
## Intoduction
Search-Based Planning is a motion planning approach that uses graph search methods to compute paths or
trajectories in a discretized environment, this project uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) 
as a Search-Based Planning Algorithms, and it's implemented using python with a predefined bitmap.

## Trials
a various trials have been carried out with different start and goal points.

**Breadth-First-Search Algorithm 1st Trial** , This path was generated using point [0,0] as an initial
point (Start) and [0,5] as an ending point, as we see the
algorithm was succeeded to achieve its mission and we have a free-obstacles path from start
point to the end one.
